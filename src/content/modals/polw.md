title: Proof of Less Work
---

In the long term, Alephium’s PoLW algorithm reduces the energy consumption of PoW.

Adaptive rewards based on hashrate and timestamp.

Internal mining cost through burning will be enabled when the hashrate and energy consumption is significantly high.

The exact way in which the PoLW algorithm works depends on the parameters set. Currently, the parameter is set so that ⅞ of block rewards will be required to mine a new block when the energy consumption is high.

The equilibrium between the miners and the protocol changes dynamically. Although this equilibrium cannot be determined in advance, given the same amount of block rewards and hashrate conditions Alephium uses ⅛ of the energy compared to Bitcoin.

The energy consumption of Bitcoin is approximately linear to the price growth, Alephium is sublinear which allows it to remain under 0.1%.
