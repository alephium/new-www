      <h4>Bounties</h4>
      <Paragraph>
        Everyone can participate as a team or hack solo (but bounties are not eligible for the main prizes). These are
        specific/smaller tasks or challenges that participants can complete for rewards. If you are a solo hacker and
        want to participate in the hackathon, this is the way (teams can also do bounties!).
      </Paragraph>

        The general goal of bounties is to provide improvements to the user/developer experience. Bounties are divided
        into 4 focus areas:
