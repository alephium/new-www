Inspired by distributed computing models, it combines DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and sharding. Being much more lightweight than other sharding methods, BlockFlow also natively supports single-step cross shard transactions, making the Alephium UX as smooth as any single chain platform.","cardText":"BlockFlow combines DAG and sharding to enable an efficient, secure and verifiable consensus algorithm.","links":[{"text":"More details","url":null,"newTab":null},{"text":"White paper","url":"https://github.com/alephium/white-paper/blob/master/alephium.pdf","newTab":true}]},"polwSection":{"title":"Proof of Less Work (PoLW)","description":"PoLW uses a clever combination of physical work and token economics to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new blocks, ensuring a reduced energy footprint compared to classic Nakamoto PoW mining.","cardText":"Blockchain's success ultimately depends on its sustainability.","links":[{"text":"More details","url":null,"newTab":false},{"text":"PoLW white paper","url":"https://github.com/alephium/white-paper/blob/master/polw.pdf","newTab":true}]},"smartContractSection":{"title":"Smart contract design","description":"Alephium's smart contracts have been designed and implemented to be scalable, functional, practical with a focus on security and reduced state usage. Its stateful UTXO model combines the advantages of the UTXO model and the account model.","cardText":"A new programming paradigm for smart contracts and dApps.","links":[{"text":"More details","url":null,"newTab":false},{"text":"Guide","url":"https://wiki.alephium.org/dapps/Technical-Guide-With-A-Fullnode","newTab":true}]},"vmsSection":{"title":"Novel VM","description":"Alephium uses a simple, safe and flexible virtual machine designed for dApps, and more specifically DeFi. Its dedicated VM leverages and improves on the UTXO model to address DeFiâ€™s security issues and execution bottleneck. Our VM focuses on contract security and IO performance. The key features are its first-class token system, multiple-caller contract and fine-grained execution model.","cardText":"VMs can be a big bottleneck when it comes to Blockchain performances.
