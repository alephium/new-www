{"data":{"modal":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"Smart contract design"},"html":"<p>Alephium proposes a stateful UTXO model which offers both layer-1 scalability and the same level of programmability as the account model. In Alephium, multiple participants and calls can be grouped in a single smart contract transaction, which means that users can interact with each other atomically through trustless P2P smart contracts. This can truly be considered as a whole new programming paradigm for decentralized applications.</p>\n<p>On Alephium, tokens are first-class citizens and UTXO-based. As a result, they are effectively owned and under the custody of the users and not of the smart contracts. Last but not least, smart contracts are supported in intragroup shard.</p>\n<p>Powerful and secure dApps can easily be built on Alephium.</p>"}]}}}
