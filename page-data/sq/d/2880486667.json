{"data":{"modal":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"About us"},"html":"<p>In 2013, during his studies at the Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne Switzerland), Cheng Wang, Alephiumâ€™s founder and core developer, started to research distributed algorithms. In 2015, he proposed the first linear time asynchronous Byzantine consensus algorithm.</p>\n<p>As he became passionate about the scalability issues of blockchain, Cheng proposed a new sharding algorithm called BlockFlow as an elegant solution. Given the industry interest in BlockFlow, Alephium was founded in 2019 to build a decentralized blockchain based on the BlockFlow algorithm. After a couple of years of hard work, Alephium has designed and implemented a brand new blockchain from scratch, proposing a new approach to scalability, smart contracts security and the energy consumption problems of blockchain.</p>\n<p>Alephium is the first operational sharded blockchain bringing scalability, ETH-inspired smart contracts, and improved energy efficiency to Bitcoin's proven core technologies. Alephium offers a whole new programming paradigm for decentralized applications, ideally suited for performance-oriented and secure DeFI.</p>"}]}}}
