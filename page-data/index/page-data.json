It improves on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable, and uses DAG data structure to reach consensus between different shards. This will allow up to 10’000 Transactions Per Second (currently more than 400 TPS vs Bitcoins 7 TPS)."},"smartContractSection":{"title":"Programmable & Secure","description":"Alephium introduces the stateful UTXO model offering layer-1 scalability and the same level of programmability as the account model used on ETH, whilst being more secure."},"polwSection":{"title":"Efficiency in Energy Consumption","description":"Alephium employs \"Proof of Less Work\", which combines physical work and coin economics to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new blocks. Given the same network conditions, Alephium uses ~90% less energy compared to Bitcoin."},"vmsSection":{"title":"Its own Virtual Machine & Programming Language.","description":"The Alphred Virtual Machine solves many of the critical issues of the current dApps platforms with huge improvements on security, development experience and introduces new paradigms such as trustless P2P smart contracts transactions. Alephium’s programming language, Ralph, has a syntax inspired by the Rust programming language. It allows for building efficient and secure smart contracts easily. It's specifically designed to facilitate the creation of DeFi dApps!"}},"numbersSection":{"title":"Some numbers","subtitle":"We're passionate and committed to outstanding quality in everything we do.
